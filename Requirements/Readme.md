# Alarm_Clock_Using_ATMEGA328
## Overview:
This is a project where I designed and built a digital alarm clock using the Atmel ATMEGA328 microcontroller.
## Features:
- 24 hour based alarm clock
- A.M./P.M. and Alarm LED indicators
- Horrible alarm sound﻿# Alarm_Clock_Using_ATMEGA328

Clock uses Arduino Uno clone as a development board with Atmega microcontroler and seven segment display. The main purpos of this project was learning how to write code for AVRs using Atmel Studio and self-etching PCBs.

## Description
The code allows for setting current time and date (including leap years) as well as setting alarm. It can also display temperature using Atmega328's internal sensor, though it cannot be described as accurate. A 4 axis joystick is used as user input.

###BOM
- Arduiono Uno (or clone)
- common anode 7 segment display
- 4 axis joystic with button
- buzzer

Compiled hex file can be uploaded via Arduino Builder or ISP programmer (for example USBasp with 6 pin adapter).

##SWOT Analysis:

###Strenghts:

1.It avilable in various colors ,so it looks attractive.

2.It has long life.

3.It provide suoerior readablity during tense.

4.It can help people track the time with the help of a countdown timer.

###Weakness:
1.Some of the 7 segment displays are limited to displaying the 16 hexadecimal characters.

2. The display's internal structure is highly complex.

###Opportunities:

1.It mainly used in digital clocks, electronics meter, and other electronic devices that display numerical imformation.

2.Convenience

3.Anonymity

4.Spreading awareness

###Threats:
1.Lack of evidence-based effectiveness.

2.Acceptance & usablity issues.

3.  Privacy/data secruity
